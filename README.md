- Tools: Nmap, Wireshark/tshark (optional)
- Scan time: <PUT DATE/TIME HERE>
- Network Range Scanned: 10.68.55.0/24

## Commands Used
1. Determine local IP:

ip -4 -o addr show scope global

sudo nmap -sS -sV -O 10.68.55.0/24 -oN scan_results.txt -oX scan_results.xml

xsltproc scan_results.xml -o scan_results.html

timeout 30s tshark -i eth0 -w ~/nmap_capture.pcap

| IP Address    | Open Ports | Services         | Risk / Notes                              |
|---------------|------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------|
| 10.68.55.221  | 53         | dnsmasq 2.51    | DNS service open on phone; minimal risk for internal network, but avoid exposing externally |
| 10.68.55.248  | 22         | OpenSSH 10.0p2  | SSH open on Linux host; ensure strong passwords or key-based authentication |
